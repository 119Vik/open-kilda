# INTRODUCTION

This directory holds the main source code for the Kilda Controller.

# DEVELOPER ONBOARDING

The code is designed to compile and run in isolation. However, it integrates with
zookeeper, kafka, storm, and the other components in the services directory. To get
the full experience, ensure the following services are operational somewhere, and pass
the configuration in.

# BUILDING

project.sh can be use to build the project.

# RUNNING

project.sh can be use to run the project.
